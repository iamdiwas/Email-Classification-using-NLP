# Email-Classification-using-NLP
This repository contains code for email classification where the email text have been processed through Natural Language Processing.  Text post-processing is done through various NLP libraries like stemming and punctuation removal. The obtained clean text is then vectored using tf-idf vectorizer, which is a efficient measure for giving weights to words which are important in a document and more descriptive for a text document.
